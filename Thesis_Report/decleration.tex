We declare that this thesis, titled \textit{“A Comparative Study of Supervised and Semi-Supervised Learning for Mango Leaf Disease Classification”}, is our own work, except where we have cited other sources. This thesis has not been submitted for any other degree, either in part or in full. While similar research has been carried out by other scholars, our study is unique because we designed a custom deep learning model. This model was trained and tested on publicly available mango leaf disease datasets, providing new insights and results in the field.
